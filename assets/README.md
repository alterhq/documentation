# Assets

This directory is the source-of-truth for bundled media used by the skill.

Public docs should reference these files as:

- `https://alterhq.com/assets-doc/...`

with `assets-doc` mapped to this local `assets/` directory.

Use `assets/manifest.csv` with `scripts/download_assets.py` to sync remote originals.
