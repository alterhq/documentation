# Workspaces and Actions Guide

## Goal

Build repeatable flows by combining workspaces and Alter Actions.

## Steps

1. Gather related files and drag them together.
2. Create a workspace (`Cmd+J`).
3. Attach workspace context to an Alter Action.
4. Save prompt conventions and expected output format.
5. Test with one realistic task and refine.
